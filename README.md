## ReadME - BMIN 503 Final Project

What the project does?

The research looks into Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's urban tree inventory with the goal of learning more about the many advantages trees offer in metropolitan areas. It looks at the ways that trees control temperatures, increase public health, act as carbon sinks, and support mental health.

Why the project is useful?

The public health and environmental sustainability intrinscially affected by this endeavor.By filtering air pollutants, which are identified as a major contributor to a number of environmental issues, trees not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also improve lung health. Moreover, research suggests that urban greenery, including trees, positively influences mental well-being by reducing stress levels. With the escalating challenges of climate change and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, understanding urban tree inventories becomes crucial. Through thorough tree cover analysis, the research provides information about the long-term viability of urban settings and the welfare of city people.

How users can get started with the project?

Those who are interested in participating with this initiative can start by going to Open Data Philly and downloading the dataset for free. The collection includes details on Philadelphia's current tree inventory, which is updated annually. Further reseearch in this area can advance knowledge about urban tree cover and its ripple effect . Researchers can also work along with experts from other fields, such urban planners, to obtain a a greater awareness of the future distribution, health, and effects of urban trees.
